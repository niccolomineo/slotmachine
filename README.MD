# Slot Machine

A basic slot machine game logic, playable as it is, but customisable further, too:

* Instantiate as many slot machines as you wish and specify a custom `selector`, `frameRate`, `maxBlur`, `hitDelay`, `superPrizeFigureIndex` and `keyToPress`
* Instantiate as many slots as you wish and specify a custom `startAtFigureIndex` and `delay`
